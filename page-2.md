All the team members from Discord Town of Salem’s ideal job is software engineer but in different fields. 


Software engineers operate in many fields and often need to create a wide arrange of products and solutions which would require them to know many different IT skills. The most important IT skills that a software engineer would need are the programming languages that are most commonly used such as Java, Javascript, Python, C etc. SQL is also an IT skill that is very important to know as a software engineers as SQL is the most commonly used database language and is used by many database engines. SQL is also the most sought after IT skill by employers in the IT field that are looking to hire. Project management is an important skill that software engineers should also have. Being able to manage a large project efficiently may reduce the workload for the whole team and also allow the team to achieve their goals faster. 


There are many important generic skills that are software engineer should have. The most basic ones like troubleshooting, planning, time management, team management, multitasking are all skills that a software engineer should have. The most important generic skill that is required by the whole group’s ideal jobs is communication. Every job requires the employee to communicate with either the team they are working in or their customers. Communication is crucial between team members because it can benefit the group in many ways. Effective communication allows the team members to understand what their position and roles are in the group and also the roles of other team members. Teams that lack communication can potentially waste energy and time doing work that is unnecessary. This could also cause conflict and problems within the group and waste even more time. Teamwork is a general skill that is essential to being a software engineer. Software engineers are often required to work in a team to tackle a project, having good teamwork can benefit the team in similar ways communication can benefit the team. Problem solving is also important for the group as that is essentially what a software engineer does, developing solutions to a customer’s problem. Being organized is also very important for any job, being organized can save a lot of potential hassle and problems. 


The three highest IT specific skills that are not in the group’s required skill set are Microsoft Windows, SAP and business management. The top three general skills that are not in the group’s required skill set are writing, detail oriented and creativity. 


After reading the burning glass data, my opinion of a software engineer has changed a bit. As expected software engineer is a job title that is in quite the high demand, however I did not expect many other job titles to be in higher demand compared to software engineers such as Java developers and front end developers.
