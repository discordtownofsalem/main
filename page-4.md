### Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices:
These devices are micro computers that are inexpensive and widely available. Arduinos are the most
Barebone out of all these devices they are designed to support modules to add to the device, these are
Called shields. Raspberry pi’s have a bit more to them, they come with these additions preinstalled on
Them (however this depends on the type of device you buy).This allows you to run an operating system
on one of them. These devices are designed for hobbyist who want a simple introduction to tinkering with
The hardware and changing and writing code for them to run. Some of the most common projects that are 
Made on arduinos is simple LED setups where people code lights in certain ways, whether this is used
To indicate something or just for decoration. A common project for raspberry pi’s is a simple file server
Or any other server which doesn't require a lot of ram or processing power; such as a website. 
These devices make great educational tools.

### Cloud services and servers:
Cloud services and servers are becoming increasingly popular with the rise of a more consistent connection
And a larger download size. This is because previously most data stored was locally, on the hard drive of
The computer, software would be shared around via disk, websites were extremely limited to the amount
Of data they could share and streaming videos wasn’t even thought about. Nowadays however data is 
Nearly always stored on servers, from the library of videos you watch and games you play. To even your
Personal data like your contacts and calendar, this allows for less powerful devices to run programs or 
Store large amounts of data. An example of this is the myDesktop app we use at RMIT this usses a server
To preform actions rather than the pc were accessing it from, which is great when trying to render or
Compute something from a underpowered pc.
