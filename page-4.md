### Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices:
These devices are micro computers that are inexpensive and widely available. Arduinos are the most
Barebone out of all these devices they are designed to support modules to add to the device, these are
Called shields. Raspberry pi’s have a bit more to them, they come with these additions preinstalled on
Them (however this depends on the type of device you buy).This allows you to run an operating system
on one of them. These devices are designed for hobbyist who want a simple introduction to tinkering with
The hardware and changing and writing code for them to run. Some of the most common projects that are 
Made on arduinos is simple LED setups where people code lights in certain ways, whether this is used
To indicate something or just for decoration. A common project for raspberry pi’s is a simple file server
Or any other server which doesn't require a lot of ram or processing power; such as a website. 
These devices make great educational tools.

### Cloud services and servers:
Cloud services and servers are becoming increasingly popular with the rise of a more consistent connection
And a larger download size. This is because previously most data stored was locally, on the hard drive of
The computer, software would be shared around via disk, websites were extremely limited to the amount
Of data they could share and streaming videos wasn’t even thought about. Nowadays however data is 
Nearly always stored on servers, from the library of videos you watch and games you play. To even your
Personal data like your contacts and calendar, this allows for less powerful devices to run programs or 
Store large amounts of data. An example of this is the myDesktop app we use at RMIT this usses a server
To preform actions rather than the pc were accessing it from, which is great when trying to render or
Compute something from a underpowered pc. 

### Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence characterised by its ability to learn from data rather than explicit programming (Ibm.com, 2019). There are a variety of methods through which this is achieved. Typically, they involve an algorithm being given a set of guiding principles to aim towards, such as conditions for winning in a game such as Go (Gibney, 2016) and given sample or training data which the algorithm can analyse to predict a best course of action (Ibm.com, 2019).
 
The strength of the approach comes from the sheer volume of data that the powerful machines used in machine learning are capable of analysing. Before AlphaGo, Google’s artificial intelligence used to play Go, ever played a game, it first studied thirty million go positions from human games(Gibney, 2016). Of course, it doesn’t just analyse data once, but continuously. After analysing the initial training data, AlphaGo improved by playing itself, over and over again (Gibney, 2016).
 
The ways these individual machines actually learn from their experience is generally what differentiates each from the others. For instance, AlphaGo uses a technique called a “neural network” which is inspired by the architecture of the human brain, “in which connections between layers of simulated neurons strengthen on the basis of experience” (Gibney, 2016).
 
The technology that makes this possible is primarily its sheer processing power. A simplified description of the mathematics of neural networks would be that it creates an extremely complex mathematical function where a layer of input variables (the first layer of neurons, as determined by real-world data) is put through a series of computations to determine the values for the next layer of neurons (intermediary variables), before again being put through a series of calculations to determine the next layer, and this process is repeated until it reaches a final output layer (Sanderson, 2019). The difference between the desired output and the actual output of the function is then calculated as a “cost” of the function, and the machine then uses a series of complex calculations to determine changes that can be made to the calculation to attempt to minimise that “cost” (Sanderson, 2019). A combination of randomisation and cost minimisation helps the machine optimise itself (Sanderson, 2019).
 
Machine learning is already allowing for artificial intelligence to do amazing things. In 2016, AlphaGo, a machine-learning algorithm created by the Google-owned company Deepmind, defeated reigning champion Lee Sedol in a six-day tournament held in Seoul (Gibney, 2016).  But these algorithms aren’t restricted to trivial pursuits like winning at board games. For instance, machine learning is being used in fields such as physical chemistry. Its uses in the field are myriad, from modelling materials and using those models to predict their behaviour in a variety of conditions to extrapolating insights from large sets of experimental data (Schneider and Guo, 2018). It is expected that machine intelligent will only become more substantially involved in the field in the coming years (Schneider and Guo, 2018). Machine learning is being used in psychology such as in its recent implementation in the study of bipolar disorder as it provides models for clinical decisions, helps to improve diagnosis and prognosis, and may even be able to identify more monolithic clinical phenotypes (Librenza-Garcia et al., 2017).
 
It’s hard to foresee much of a limit to the fields which machine learning could impact. Any field in which data analysis or modelling is required could very easily see benefits from machine learning, even in its current state. As the technology improves, the number of fields into which it could expand could increase exponentially (IBM.com, 2019).
 
These developments are likely to change the way data-intensive problems are approached, though, with the ever increasing data availability due to developments such as big data, the breadth of fields in which that kind of data is available could also increase (Oracle.com, 2019). Rather than using researchers to evaluate data manually, much of that analysis could be handed over to machine-learning algorithms who could process data significantly more quickly than a human, but also, with time, could also do so more thoroughly (Ibm.com, 2019).
 
An example of a less intuitive field in which machine learning could have a significant impact is in understanding of dialogue, which could be used in the creation and improvement of phone assistants. There are parallels between a game like Go and a conversation in the way each participant takes their turn and has an objective (Gibney, 2016). The use of this technology could allow virtual assistants to develop a much deeper understanding of the users’ requests.
 
There is even potential for machine learning to impact fields not just through analysis and modelling tools but even to take over design. In recent years, there have been noteworthy instances of advanced machine learning being used to iterate on aircraft engine design through automatic knowledge transfer (Min et al., 2017). If machine learning algorithms are used to generate efficient design approaches, then in theory they could be used to design cars, or electronics, or houses. There is a very real possibility that jobs like engineer or architect or mechanic could be replaced or reduced due to the development of machine-learning technologies.
 
Even in healthcare, there are a variety of examples of machine learning being used in diagnosis and prognosis such as a recent study performed at Akershus University Hospital (IBM.com, 2019). There thousands of radiology reports were analysed by a machine-learning algorithm to analyse whether the medical professionals were conforming to best practices (IBM.com, 2019). It isn’t too farfetched to assume that some of the diagnostic work could one day be handled by a machine intelligence, putting many radiologists and medical imaging professionals out of a job.
 
In daily life, machine learning is being incorporated into more and more of society. For instance, media curation is increasingly handled by machine-learning algorithms. Websites like YouTube and Netflix increasingly use machine-learning algorithms to recommend media to their users (Chalmers, 2019). And it’s not just content recommendation within media websites. Personalised advertisements are becoming more and more prominent, with many heralding artificially intelligent content curators as the “next stage of the digital revolution” (Chalmers, 2019).
 
As big data and machine learning become more and more prominent and powerful, it is likely that the majority of interfaces we interact with on a day-to-day basis are personally curated to our needs and tendencies through a machine-learning algorithm (Chalmers, 2019). Thus, the way we interact with the world around us may become entirely different to the way our friends or family do.

Ultimately, Machine Learning has the potential to have an enormous impact on the way our society functions, from research to design to media and the ways we interact with the world around us. 

### Cybersecurity:
Cybersecurity is the protection of system networks and programs from digital attacks. (Cisco.com, 2019). Digital attacks are usually called cyber attacks and the purpose of these attacks are usually aimed at assessing, changing or just destroying digital information with unauthorized access. Other reasons for these cyber attacks also include money extortion and interruption of day to day business procedures. Cybersecurity aims to develop methods and precautions to prevent these sorts of attacks from happening. 

Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving technology due to how important it is for everything IT related. Being able to implement effective cybersecurity measures have become more challenging over the years as technology improves and hackers becoming more and more knowledgeable and innovative. It has also become harder due to the amount of devices surpassing the amount of people there are in the world. 

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted recently by the EU in 2018 with most organisations aligning their security strategies with the regulations. The GDPR will help in the advancement of cybersecurity as this will affect not only European based organisations but also many organisations outside of EU that conduct business with them. Organisation will need to implement auditing and monitoring solutions in order to strengthen the protection over the data they have stored. (GDPR Report, 2018). The adoption of this regulation will help strengthen cybersecurity overall greatly in the next few years, however the adoption process will be slow in the beginning according to the GDPR report. 

It is hard to tell what will be able to done soon in the near future as cybersecurity evolves based on the problems that it is given. New security threats arise every year, new strains of ransomware, scams, viruses etc. Cybersecurity technologies will be developed to solve these issues, so what will be able to be done in the future will depend on the security threats that are discovered. However, due to cloud services becoming more developed and popular in recent years, cloud security may become the top priority for cybersecurity developments in the future. As the cloud environment is more widely adopted nowadays, it becomes a bigger target for security attacks (GDPR Report, 2018). It is very likely that in the next few years there will be many security problems that emerge in the cloud due to the increase in demand. It will be a top priority for organizations to develop security methods to defend against these security risks. Another obvious advancement for cybersecurity is that more people will be knowledgeable in the IT field. This will help in reducing the victims to ransomware. As they become more tech savvy, the chances of them falling into a ransomware scam will become less likely. 

Everyone in the world is able to benefit from cybersecurity. Cybersecurity advancements and developments will help protect everyone’s personal data that they have stored digitally. The risks of falling victim to cyber attacks such as extortion, identity theft and the loss of important data will be lower. Critical infrastructure that is essential to a functioning society will also be more secure. This will benefit everyone as we all rely on infrastructure such as financial service companies, power plants, transport services etc. which are all targets to cyberattacks.
