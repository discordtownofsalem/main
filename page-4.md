### Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices:
These devices are micro computers that are inexpensive and widely available. Arduinos are the most
Barebone out of all these devices they are designed to support modules to add to the device, these are
Called shields. Raspberry pi’s have a bit more to them, they come with these additions preinstalled on
Them (however this depends on the type of device you buy).This allows you to run an operating system
on one of them. These devices are designed for hobbyist who want a simple introduction to tinkering with
The hardware and changing and writing code for them to run. Some of the most common projects that are 
Made on arduinos is simple LED setups where people code lights in certain ways, whether this is used
To indicate something or just for decoration. A common project for raspberry pi’s is a simple file server
Or any other server which doesn't require a lot of ram or processing power; such as a website. These devices make great educational tools.
